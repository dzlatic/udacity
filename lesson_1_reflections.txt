What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is more flexible, and allows dersired level of control. Automatic savings 
	are only good when there is a concern about loosing data.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is meant to deal with code taht assume multiple files, while Google Docs
	are not oriented to document collections but to single documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We use log to locate comits of interest and then we use diff to find exact differences
	we are interested in

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
